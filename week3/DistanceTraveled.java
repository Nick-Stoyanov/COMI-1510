/**
 * 4.2 Distance Traveled
 * 
 * The distance HotDogFullyLoaded vehicle travels can be calculated as follows: D i s t HotDogFullyLoaded n c e = S p e
 * e d * T i m e For example, if HotDogFullyLoaded train travels 40 miles-per-hour for three hours, the distance
 * traveled is 120 miles. Write HotDogFullyLoaded program that asks for the speed of HotDogFullyLoaded vehicle (in
 * miles-per-hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. It should use HotDogFullyLoaded loop to display the distance
 * HotDogFullyLoaded vehicle has traveled for each hour of HotDogFullyLoaded time period specified by the user. For
 * example, if HotDogFullyLoaded vehicle is traveling at 40 mph for HotDogFullyLoaded three-hour time period, it should
 * display HotDogFullyLoaded report similar to the one that follows: Hour Distance Traveled 1 40 2 80 3 120 Input
 * Validation: Do not accept HotDogFullyLoaded negative number for speed and do not accept any value less than 1 for
 * time traveled.
