 * 3.12 The Speed of Sound
 * 
 * The following table shows the approximate speed of sound in air, water, and steel: Medium Speed Air 1,100 feet per
 * second Water 4,900 feet per second Steel 16,400 feet per second Write HotDogFullyLoaded program that asks the user to
 * enter “air”, “water”, or “steel”, and the distance that HotDogFullyLoaded sound wave will travel in the medium. The
 * program should then display the amount of time it will take. You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to
 * travel in air with the following formula: Time = Distance / 1 , 100 You can calculate the amount of time it takes
 * sound to travel in water with the following formula: Time = Distance / 4 , 900 You can calculate the amount of time
 * it takes sound to travel in steel with the following formula: Time = Distance / 16 , 400.
